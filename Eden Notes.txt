What a most excellent surprise, first off thank you much for letting us play around with a skin we've been anticipating for awhile now. Especially nice of you to do it before you got busy with life and had to slow your development of it.

Soon as I saw this post I immediately downloaded and installed and first impressions sure do not disappoint. Love the overall color scheme of it all. Skin feels very light and fast. View types are well thought out and the use of the non-official image types (banner, landscape, logo) are done to great effect.

Really love your image choices for settings, genres and the Icon layout for home screen. I really wouldn't want to think how much googleing that took to find images that matched up in theme.

It's a Alpha release, so won't get into requests because there is a lot I'm sure you've got planned for it. But, I'll just point out two little bugs I found.

1) Logo view type for TV Shows doesn't show the Logo.png just the label.

    In Viewtype_logo.xml I found
    Code:

    $INFO[ListItem.FolderName]logo.png

    I changed this to
    Code:

    $INFO[ListItem.Path]logo.png

    and the logos then showed up. Not sure if this is correct or not, but it worked for me


2) If you have music playing and go browsing around throughout the skin (TV, Movies, Addons, etc) The information panel at the bottom becomes a little cluttered.
The Now Playing info overlaps the information text.
Here's a screen shot to make it easy to see


As far as Alpha releases go, this is a pretty solid one. Running on pre-eden with no lockups, or performance issues or show stopping problems so far. Thanks again for releasing what you have so far!

Edit: I just re-read your post and just caught the "post bugs except for music and pictures, since they aren't done" Oops. In that case you can ignore Issue #2 since you are most likely already aware of it

Was messing around with the Includes.xml to see if I could figure out the Date Label not showing, and finally figured it out.

Just changed:
Code:

<visible>SubString(System.Date,$LOCALIZE[14])</visible>

to
Code:

<visible>SubString(System.Date(DDD),$LOCALIZE[14])</visible>

Added the (DDD) to all the days and now got it showing up as it should. Just thought I'd pass it on as one less thing to look up for Eden

Rygrath,
If you want more Pre-Eden issues to look into, there is one in the Videos section.

Steps:
1) Select one of the sections in the Movies Submenu, for example Genre.
2) Go back to the home screen.
3) Select Videos.
Result: You're taken to the subsection you picked in step 1 instead of the root node like in Dharma.
